# seed
I have no idea how, but this repository will change the world for those who need it changed.

The idea here is that there is a vast under served community in the world, how can their lives be made better?

I live in the United States of America. My intention is to learn how to solve problems here so that people in other countries can learn from the solutions and vice versa.

Personally, I give up. I am tired of the endless meaningless pursuit of stuff. I have always absolutely admired talents, skills, and abilities.

My goal is to figure out how to transfer these talents, skills, and abilities that the so called rich have access to and give them to the ones that need it most.

Fools errand? Guess I am a fool.

Education and technology have changed my life in amazing ways as it has for so many other individuals. I believe that education and technology are the key to living a more peaceful and proserous life here on the 3rd Rock from the Sun that we call home.

It is said, "where there is a will there is a way". I am willing. How about you?

As a first move, I made a few decisions:

- The project will be called seed.

- I want all the code written in JavaScript. Not that I think JS is a great language, but it is the language of the World Wide Web and therefore the most accessible.

- That decision of using JavaScript will most likely result in using Node to some degree or another.

- No politics. I don't care. Repeat I do not care.

- I chose the Unlicense license as it puts this project in the public domain.

- I registered the domain seedjs.org. As a place to house information about the project.

- I will do my best to take care of all and any administrative needs of running a non-profit until it grows beyond my capabilities.

That's it. That's all that I have right now. It's literally the seed of an idea that will grow over time.

We must take an interest in our fellow human beings. We can no longer live in silos and ignore those that go without their very basic needs met.
